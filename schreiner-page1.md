Note: I turned dates like 6.3.1967 into 6 March 1867 in order to disambigute them.  I usually use British spelling, except where that is ambiguous, in which case I use American spelling. (One example is "labor", meaning work, which in B.E. is "labour" meaning the process of giving birth.) Editorial marks are enclosed in brackets.  Such marks are: original hyphenation marks, the original word in case I'm not sure that I've found the precise translation, expanded abbreviations, and missing words in otherwise ungrammatical sentences.

Albert H. Schreiner				Berlin, in January 1978
1157  B e r l i n
Rud. Große Str. 16

[This could be "Rud." or "Kud.".  I thought this might be a district in Berlin, but none of the contemporary ones contain "ud".  Also I couldn't find any "Große Straße", not even in a list of historical street names. The closest is "Große Fankfurter Strasse", but that was only its name from 1929 until 1949, when it became "Stalinallee", and from 1962 was known as "Karl-Marx-Allee", so it's a bit of a mystery. It is certainly not "Kud[amm]", the abbreviation for the Kurfürstendamm, since that was in the western part of the city, which Mr Schreiner, as citizen of the GDR, would not have been permitted to live in. It cannot be a misspelling of "Fritz-Große-Strasse" (Fritz Große was a member of the GDR foreign ministry) as "Rud.[olf] Große Straße" because that street got its name only in 1985. The postcode 1157 does not appear in a list of old postcodes of Berlin. It's also unlikely that someone who lived or worked in the place would misspell his own postcode. So you have a bit of a mystery on your hands.]

# Curriculum Vitae

## Origins

I was born on 7 August 1892 in Aglasterhausen, district of Moosbach (Baden) as the fourth child of Franz Hermann Schreiner (6 March 1867 - Sept. 1927) and Sophie Schrei[-]ber, bee Merlock (27 April 1865 - 1940). My father was a metal lathe operator [Metalldreher], unionised and politically - SPD [Social Democratic Party] - organised, [he] changed his party affiliation during the first World War as Steward [Betriebsvertrauensmann] of the German Metal Worker's Association to USPD [Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands] and 1920 to KPD [Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands]. From 1921 until his death he was employed in the local administration [Ortsverwaltung] Stuttgart of the DMV.  My mother came from the family of a swabian country butcher.  She hard a hard life full of labor, in order to keep above water 11 children, 7 of which survived, because the father was often unemployed, especially in times of crises, and without support there were weeks and monthe of deprivation. My mother was not organised politically.

## Childhood and Apprenticeship

From Easter 1899 until December 1906, I went to elementary school in Chemnitz (Sa. [Sachsen]).  From my 10th year on I had to contribute to the family's livelihood through running errands ["Ausläufer" is a noun] and other jobs.  This didn't hinder my good progress at school. The
