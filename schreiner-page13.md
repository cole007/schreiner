Note: I used MultiMarkdown format (mainly because of the footnote syntax) and tried to be as close to the original as possible to me. Therefore I didn't add small words which in my opinion should be there (like "a link to USA", which I usually would write as "a link to the USA"). I'm not sure if this is a good practice for translating, but anyway the meaning should be clear (I hope).

In a personal letter to me, Heinrich Mann, who led the popular front committee, did comment about the book with very approving words.

In these years I also had a very tight relation with my painter friend Max Lingner. [^1]

Apart from that I delivered various contributions to a german resistance broadcast station [^2] and for illegal transfered agitation material to german soldiers.

On 21 July 1939 me and my family were expatriated and our civic rights were deprived by the fascist authorities.

## Internment in France

In September 1939 we were internmented and I had to go through a lot of camps in that time. (Among others I was together with Walter Beling [^3], Paul Bertz, Walter Hähnel, Lex Ende etc.) With the help of Gen. from the camp [^4] I was able to leave to Mexico. Primarily Rudi Feistmann helped me to get a link to USA and Mexico. In Casablanca our journey was stopped by the french government. Until September 1941 we were internmented in Morocco. (I was there with A. Deter, Max Schröder, Paul Krauter) Because we were in possession of american transit visas, we were able to journey on in September, but were detained right after our arrival in New York in Ellis Island and after about six weeks we were released with the help of our american friends.

[^1]: From my point of view my translation sounds a bit like it is indicating some liason, but in the German original there's no such indication.

[^2]: I'm not sure if I get this right. The wording "für den nach Deutschland arbeitenden Sender" translated literally would be something like "for the towards Germany working broadcast station". I take this as some system critic program.

[^3]: Not sure if it's Beling or Boling.

[^4]: Not sure if Gen. is a name or the abbreviation of "Genosse" (= comrade).
